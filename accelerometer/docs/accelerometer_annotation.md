Creating annotation for accelerometer data is time consuming and expensive. For capture-24 dataset, images were captured every 30 seconds and manually labelled. This labelling was mapping to 2000 human activities defined by the international standard compendium of physical activities. Each category of activities has a MET value assigned. Thus, following idea hold great potential:
1. labelling images by annotating them with a physical activity status without human intervention.
2. Blurring images of humans within the captured pictures without compromising on the activity classification.

Some numbers: It took 1.5 years to annotate activities for 151 participants with images captured every 30 seconds and costed around $500k.
