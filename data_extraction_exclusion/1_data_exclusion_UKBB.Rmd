We load and/or install the packages we will be using:

```{r, include=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(data.table)
#install.packages(tidyverse)
library(tidyverse)
```

We import all data for participants with accelerometer data:

```{r}
# Change the locations to your user folder data files
#full_df <- read.csv("/home/hiroshi/projects/UKBB/Yacine_extract/final_df_full.csv")
full_df <- read.csv("/home/yacine/UKBB_beluga/final_df_full.csv") # copy in /home/yacine/survival_analysis

```

We convert "-1" and "-3" values to NAs for the self-reported PA values for 
instance 0 (PA4)
```{r}

    duration_moderate_activity_0 = if_else(as.numeric(as.character(duration_moderate_activity_0)) %in% c(-1, -3), 0, as.numeric(as.character(duration_moderate_activity_0))),
    
    duration_vigorous_activity_0 = if_else(as.numeric(as.character(duration_vigorous_activity_0)) %in% c(-1, -3), 0, as.numeric(as.character(duration_vigorous_activity_0)))
    
    #duration_heavy_DIY_0 = na_if(as.numeric(as.character(duration_heavy_DIY_0)), -1),
    #duration_heavy_DIY_0 = na_if(duration_heavy_DIY_0, -3),

   # duration_light_DIY_0 = na_if(duration_light_DIY_0, -3),

```


We convert "-1" and "-3" values to NAs for the self-reported PA values for 
instances 1 (2012-2013) and instances 2 (2014+)
```{r}
#full_df <- full_df %>%

We combine the self reported PA data for instances 0
```{r}

#full_df <- full_df %>%

    #duration_vigorous_activity = coalesce(duration_vigorous_activity_1, duration_vigorous_activity_2),
    #duration_heavy_DIY = coalesce(duration_heavy_DIY_1, duration_heavy_DIY_2),
    #duration_light_DIY = coalesce(duration_light_DIY_1, duration_light_DIY_2)
  #)
```

### PA4 prep:
Combining the duration_moderate_activity_0 and duration_vigorous_activity_0
we create the "MVPA_min_PA4" by doing the sum of both columns

```{r}

full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(
    MVPA_min_PA4 = coalesce(duration_vigorous_activity_0, 0) + coalesce(duration_moderate_activity_0, 0),
    MVPA_min_PA4 = if_else(is.na(MVPA_min_PA4), 0, MVPA_min_PA4),
    MVPA_min_PA4 = MVPA_min_PA4 * 7 # transform daily data to weekly
  )

```


Combine green/blue spaces data into one columns
```{r}

full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(greenspace_300m = coalesce(greenspace_300m_0, greenspace_300m_1))

full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(naturalenv_300m = coalesce(naturalenv_300m_0, naturalenv_300m_1))

full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(water_300m = coalesce(water_300m_0, water_300m_1))

######## REMOVE UNNECESSARY COLUMNS
After looking at the data, I realized that some columns that we extracted (for
multiple instances) provided more "NA" data than actual data, so I removed these 
columns:
```{r}

full_df <- full_df %>%
  dplyr::select(-diabetes_1, -diabetes_2, -diabetes_3, 
         -processed_meat_1, -processed_meat_2, -processed_meat_3, -X191.0.0.1, -duration_moderate_activity_1, -duration_moderate_activity_2, -duration_moderate_activity_3, -duration_vigorous_activity_1, -duration_vigorous_activity_2, -duration_vigorous_activity_3, -duration_heavy_DIY_1, -duration_heavy_DIY_2, -duration_heavy_DIY_3, -duration_light_DIY_1, -duration_light_DIY_2, -duration_light_DIY_3, -domgarden_1000m_0, -domgarden_300m_0, -greenspace_1000m_0, -domgarden_1000m_1, -domgarden_300m_1, -greenspace_1000m_1, -water_1000m_0, -water_1000m_1, -dist_coast_0, -dist_coast_1)

```


########## Exclusions: these following commands will only keep the data we are ##########  
            not seeking to exclude

First, we would like to keep count of the number of participants that are excluded
at each step. So we create this function that will allow us to do so:
```{r}
count_exclusions <- function(df_before, df_after) {
  n_before <- nrow(df_before)
  n_after <- nrow(df_after)
  excluded <- n_before - n_after
  print(paste("Participants excluded:", excluded))
  return(list(df = df_after, excluded = excluded))
}

initial_n <- nrow(full_df) # number of participants at the beginning
print(initial_n)
```

## Starting point: We remove participants for which there are no raw accelerometer data
```{r}

# we want to count how many people were excluded in this section
total_excluded_lq <- 0

df_before <- full_df

# remove participants for which accel_raw == NA
full_df <- full_df %>% filter(!is.na(accel_raw))
full_df <- full_df[full_df$accel_raw != "", ]

result <- count_exclusions(df_before, full_df)
total_excluded_lq <- total_excluded_lq + result$excluded
```

## Exclusion 1: Low quality accelerometer data

### 1.1. Devices poorly calibrated
```{r}
df_before <- full_df
full_df <- full_df[full_df$quality_good_calibration == "Yes", ]
result <- count_exclusions(df_before, full_df)
total_excluded_lq <- total_excluded_lq + result$excluded
```

### 1.2. Participants for whom \>1% of values were clipped (fell outside the 
sensor's range) before or after calibration:
```{r}
df_before <- full_df
full_df <- full_df[(full_df$clips_before_cal < 0.01 * full_df$total_reads) & (full_df$clips_after_cal < 0.01 * full_df$total_reads), ]
result <- count_exclusions(df_before, full_df)
total_excluded_lq <- total_excluded_lq + result$excluded
```

### 1.3 Insufficient wear time
```{r}
df_before <- full_df
full_df <- full_df[full_df$quality_good_wear_time == "Yes", ]# OxWearable note: Note that this has already been calculated in UKB, we don't need to manually calculate it: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=90015
result <- count_exclusions(df_before, full_df)
total_excluded_lq <- total_excluded_lq + result$excluded
```

### 1.4 Unrealistically high acceleration values
```{r}
df_before <- full_df
full_df <- full_df[full_df$overall_activity < 100, ]
result <- count_exclusions(df_before, full_df)
total_excluded_lq <- total_excluded_lq + result$excluded
```

```{r}
print(paste("Total participants excluded due to not being in acceleromete subcohort or low accelerometer data quality:", total_excluded_lq))
```


## Exclusion 2: Reported CVD

```{r}
# we extract the CVD date columns
date_columns <- c(
  'stroke_date', 'ischaemic_stroke_date', 'intracerebral_haemorrhage_date', 
  'myocardial_infarction_date', 'STEMI_date', 'NSTEMI_date' , 'date_end_accel', 'date_start_accel' 
)

# we format the date columns
for (col in date_columns) {
  full_df[[col]] <- as.Date(full_df[[col]], format="%Y-%m-%d")
}
```


### Removal of CVD cases based on the baseline date of acceleroemter for each person:

```{r}
# Max date of diagnosis (hospital record update) is 2022 Dec. 
summary(full_df$stroke_date) #originally 1140 excluded
summary(full_df$ischaemic_stroke_date)
summary(full_df$intracerebral_haemorrhage_date)
summary(full_df$myocardial_infarction_date) # orignally 1796  excluded
summary(full_df$STEMI_date)
summary(full_df$NSTEMI_date)
df_beforeExclusion <- full_df %>% dplyr::select(all_of(c(date_columns, "eid")))

# cut-off date = 2013-01-01 because we do not want to keep participants that reported
# having a CVD < 2013
cut_off_date <- "2013-01-01"
cut_off_date_personal <- full_df$date_end_accel 
full_df$indicator_drop_stroke <- 1
full_df$indicator_drop_mi <- 1
full_df[is.na(full_df[["stroke_date"]]) | full_df[["stroke_date"]] >= as.Date(cut_off_date_personal), "indicator_drop_stroke"] <- 0 
full_df[is.na(full_df[["myocardial_infarction_date"]]) | full_df[["myocardial_infarction_date"]] >= as.Date(cut_off_date_personal), "indicator_drop_mi"] <- 0

sum(full_df$indicator_drop_stroke) # to remove. 1251
sum(full_df$indicator_drop_mi)  # to remove, 2181
full_df %>% dplyr::filter(indicator_drop_mi == 1 & indicator_drop_stroke==1) %>% nrow 

# 
print("Number of people excluded based on the exact date of acclerometer is \n")
full_df %>% filter(indicator_drop_mi == 1 | indicator_drop_stroke==1) %>% dim()

# Create data frame after exclusion 
full_df_CVD <- full_df %>% # 3315 removed by this definition 
  filter(indicator_drop_mi == 0 & indicator_drop_stroke==0)

# Check dates 
min(full_df_CVD$stroke_date, na.rm = T)
max(full_df_CVD$stroke_date, na.rm = T)
min(full_df_CVD$myocardial_infarction_date, na.rm = T)
max(full_df_CVD$myocardial_infarction_date, na.rm = T)

# Confirm the last date of diagnosis among those who are removed
df_beforeExclusion %>% 
  anti_join(full_df_CVD, by =join_by(eid)) %>% 
  select(all_of(date_columns)) %>% 
  apply(1, FUN = min, na.rm=T) %>% max()

# Confirm the # of excluded # 2936
df_beforeExclusion %>% 
    anti_join(full_df_CVD, by =join_by(eid)) %>% 
    select(all_of(date_columns)) %>% 
    apply(1, FUN = min, na.rm=T) %>% length
#format(as.Date(.), "%Y-%m") %>% unique()  %>%  sort

```


### Find the last date of hospital records and make exclusion based on the dates:

```{r}
# we create an empty list that will be filled with the number of excluded participants
exclusions <- list()

# we create a function which will allow us to count the number of excluded participants
count_and_filter_dates <- function(df, date_column, cut_off_date) {
  initial_count <- nrow(df)
  df <- df[is.na(df[[date_column]]) | df[[date_column]] >= as.Date(cut_off_date), ]
  final_count <- nrow(df)
  excluded_count <- initial_count - final_count # number of excluded rows (participants)
  print(paste("Excluded", date_column, excluded_count))
  return(list(df = df, excluded_count = excluded_count))
}

# create loop to count number of participants excluded for each CVD
total_excluded_cvd <- 0
for (col in date_columns) {
  result <- count_and_filter_dates(full_df, col, cut_off_date)
  full_df <- result$df
  exclusions[[paste("Excluded based on", col)]] <- result$excluded_count
  total_excluded_cvd <- total_excluded_cvd + result$excluded_count
}

# Print total exclusions for step 2
print(paste("Total participants excluded because of CVD:", total_excluded_cvd)) #originally 2936

```


## Exclusion 3: Remove participants for whom we have lost follow-up data

```{r}
df_before <- full_df
full_df <- full_df[full_df$date_lost_followup == "", ]
result <- count_exclusions(df_before, full_df)
total_excluded_lfu <- result$excluded

# Print total exclusions for step 3
print(paste("Total participants excluded in step 3:", total_excluded_lfu))

```

## Final count after exclusion steps 1 to 3:
```{r}

########## Data Recoding ########## 

We recode certain variables: 
### Note: all the data coding/mapping was an extra step we had to do ###

1. Ethnicity:

```{r}

##first we create a dictionnary mapping for the ethnicity codes
## *** important: this is not a step that was shown by OxWearables. We had to this
## ourselves. The codes are provided here: https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/coding.cgi?id=1001

ethnicity_coding <- c(
  "1" = "White",
  "1001" = "British",
  "2001" = "White and Black Caribbean",
  "3001" = "Indian",
  "4001" = "Caribbean",
  "2" = "Mixed",
  "1002" = "Irish",
  "2002" = "White and Black African",
  "3002" = "Pakistani",
  "4002" = "African",
  "3" = "Asian or Asian British",
  "1003" = "Any other white background",
  "2003" = "White and Asian",
  "3003" = "Bangladeshi",
  "4003" = "Any other Black background",
  "4" = "Black or Black British",
  "2004" = "Any other mixed background",
  "3004" = "Any other Asian background",
  "5" = "Chinese",
  "6" = "Other ethnic group",
  "-1" = "Do not know",
  "-3" = "Prefer not to answer"
)

## we replace the codes by their meaning:
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(ethnicity_raw = recode(as.character(ethnicity_raw), !!!ethnicity_coding))


## 2. now we can proceed with the recoding suggested by OxWearables:
full_df$ethnicity <-
  plyr::revalue(
    full_df$ethnicity_raw,
    c(
      "British" = "White",
      "Any other white background" = "White",
      "Irish" = "White",
      "White and Asian" = "Non-white",
      "Caribbean" = "Non-white",
      "Chinese"   = "Non-white",
      "Pakistani"  = "Non-white",
      "White and Black African" = "Non-white",
      "Other ethnic group"  = "Non-white",
      "Any other mixed background" = "Non-white",
      "African"    = "Non-white",
      "White and Black Caribbean" = "Non-white",
      "Prefer not to answer" = NA,
      "Indian"  = "Non-white",
      "White" = "White",
      "Do not know" = NA,
      "Any other Black background" = "Non-white",
      "Any other Asian background"  = "Non-white",
      "Bangladeshi"  = "Non-white",
      "Mixed"  = "Non-white",
      "Asian or Asian British"  = "Non-white",
      "Black or Black British"  = "Non-white"
    )
  )



table(full_df$ethnicity_raw, full_df$ethnicity, useNA = "always")
```


2. Smoking and tdi:

```{r}
# Townsend Index:
full_df$tdi <- full_df$tdi_raw

# Smoking
## 1. Data coding for smoking: https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/coding.cgi?id=90
smoking_coding <- c(
  "0" = "Never",
  "1" =	"Previous",
  "2" =	"Current",
  "-3" = "Prefer not to answer"
)

## we replace the codes by their meaning:
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(smoking = recode(as.character(smoking_raw), !!!smoking_coding))

## 2. OxWearable recoding:
full_df$smoking <-
  plyr::revalue(full_df$smoking, replace = c("Prefer not to answer" = NA)) 

table(full_df$smoking, full_df$smoking_raw, useNA = "always")
```



3. Fish and meats:

```{r}

## we replace the codes by their meaning:
### oily fish:
full_df$oily_fish_raw <- full_df$oily_fish  
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(oily_fish = recode(as.character(oily_fish), !!!meat_coding))

### non-oily fish:
full_df$non_oily_fish_raw <- full_df$non_oily_fish  
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(non_oily_fish = recode(as.character(non_oily_fish  ), !!!meat_coding))

### processed meats:
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(processed_meat_0 = recode(as.character(processed_meat_0), !!!meat_coding ))

table(full_df$oily_fish, full_df$oily_fish_raw, useNA = "always" ) # Yacine comment: remove? There twice

full_df <- full_df %>%
  select(-processed_meat_0)

table(full_df$processed_meat, full_df$processed_meat_raw, useNA = "always" )
```

4. Red meats:
* we need to create the red_meat column as the UKBiobank data only provides data 
for different types of red meat separately (i.e. lamb, beef and pork) *

```{r}

## we replace "Do not know"s and "Prefer not to say"s by NAs - we will drop
## them later on anyways:
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(across(c(beef, lamb, pork), ~ na_if(., -1))) %>%
  mutate(across(c(beef, lamb, pork), ~ na_if(., -3)))

## we create the red meat column by adding all the values for beef, lamb and pork: 
full_df$red_meat <- rowSums(full_df[c("beef", "lamb", "pork")], na.rm = TRUE)

table(full_df$red_meat) # visualize all the value that take red_meat

## we create coding for red meats:
red_meat_coding <- c(
  "0" = "Never",
  "1"  = "Less than once a week",
  "2"  = "Once a week",
  "3"  = "2-4 times a week",
  "4"  = "5-6 times a week",
  "5"  = "Once or more daily",
  "6"  = "Once or more daily",

  "11" = "Once or more daily",
  "12" = "Once or more daily",
  "13" = "Once or more daily",
  "15" = "Once or more daily"
)

## we replace the coding by their meaning:
full_df$red_meat_raw <- full_df$red_meat
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(red_meat = recode(as.character(red_meat), !!!red_meat_coding))

# Red meat
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(red_meat = case_when(
    red_meat == "2-4 times a week" ~ "2-4 times a week",
    red_meat %in% c("Once a week", "Less than once a week", "Never") ~ "Less than 2 times a week",
    red_meat %in% c("5-6 times a week", "Once or more daily") ~ "More than 4 times a week",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))

table(full_df$red_meat, full_df$red_meat_raw, useNA = "always" )


```



5. Education:

```{r}
#### Note: OxWearable use "age education"; we are using "qualifications education"

## we replace the education codes by their meaning:
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(education_level = recode(as.character(education_raw), !!!education_coding))

## we recode again to have less education classifications
full_df <- full_df %>%
  mutate(education_level = case_when(
    education_level == "College or University degree" ~ "College or University degree",

6. BMI:

```{r}

############ Final exclusion ############

## Exclusion 4: Missing covariate data

### 4.1 We remove rows for participants that have missing data for ethnicity, education, sex, birth date, smoking status, alcohol consumption, Townsend Deprivation Index; oily fish, fresh fruit, cooked veggies or processed meat consumption, and BMI.

```{r}

We create a "age-at-accelerometer-wear variable":

We make a function to cut by quantile:

```{r}
qtile_cut <-  function(x, probs = seq(0, 1, 0.25), na.rm = TRUE, labels = NULL) {
    breaks <- quantile(x = x, probs = probs, na.rm = na.rm)
    out <- cut(x = x, breaks = breaks, labels = labels, right = FALSE, include.lowest = TRUE)
    return(out)

```


We cut overall activity and Townsend Deprivation Index into quarters:

```{r}
full_df$overall_activity_quarters <- qtile_cut(full_df$overall_activity, labels = c("Quarter 1", "Quarter 2", "Quarter 3", "Quarter 4"))
# OxWearable Note: The TDI classification here was quarters of the study population, which was used in the example papers. However, our group now typically uses TDI scaled to quarters of the UK population, 
# as listed [here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/statistics.digitalresources.jisc.ac.uk/dkan/files/Townsend_Deprivation_Scores/UK%20Townsend%20Deprivation%20Scores%20from%202011%20census%20data.pdf, page 15)

full_df$tdi_quarters <- qtile_cut(full_df$tdi, labels = c("Quarter 1", "Quarter 2", "Quarter 3", "Quarter 4"))


boxplot(overall_activity ~ overall_activity_quarters, data = full_df)
boxplot(tdi ~ tdi_quarters, data = full_df)


```




We save the the final df which includes the exlucded participants and the recoding
suggested by OxWearables (as well as the data mapping we had to do)

```{r}
write.csv(full_df, "/home/yacine/UKBB_beluga/df_exc_recode.csv", row.names = FALSE)
